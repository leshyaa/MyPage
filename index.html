    <p>
        I am an Electrical Enginnering 2nd year B.Tech student. I am originally from Chennai, studied and grew up here. My trivial pursuits at convincing my parents to buy me some toy when I was 6 years old lead to organizing stalls at my middle school fair, going on to participate in debate and MUN competitions, researching avidly about the ins and outs of topics that I am defending. Conducting comprehensive research and presenting it concisely, excites me. I believe that I am a fast-learner, hardworker and make up for what I lack by learning and doing better. Do check out the rest of the website :)
